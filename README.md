# Giphy Website Replica

The goal of this project is to replicate [Giphy's](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api) website by using [their API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api), which has several endpoints that allows the user to fetch multiple kinds of data, and even upload GIFs via POST requests. I also replicate most of their design, with some slight modifications to fit the scope and limitations of the project. This is begin developed with HTML5, CSS3, JS, Bootstrap 4, SASS, npm, Gulp and webpack.


## Getting started

When running the project for the first time, use the following commands:

```
cd project/save/path
git clone https://github.com/pvnetto/Giphy-Replica.git
cd Giphy-Replica
npm install
gulp
```

This will create a local copy of the project in your machine, install all the dependencies and run all gulp tasks.

After running the project for the first time with npm install, you won't need to do it anymore when reopening the project. So if this is not the first time you're running it, all you have to do is go to the project's directory and run the gulp command to run all gulp tasks.


## Roadmap

* [ ] Upload GIFs to Giphy through the Upload page

# Giphy Website Replica

[Live Version](https://giphy-clone-js.herokuapp.com/index.html)

The goal of this project is to replicate [Giphy's](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api) website by using [their API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api), which has several endpoints that allows the user to fetch multiple kinds of data, and even upload GIFs via POST requests. I also replicate most of their design, with some slight modifications to fit the scope and limitations of the project. This is begin developed with HTML5, CSS3, JS, Bootstrap 4, SASS, npm, Gulp and webpack.


## Getting started

When running the project for the first time, use the following commands:

```
cd project/save/path
git clone https://github.com/pvnetto/Giphy-Replica.git
